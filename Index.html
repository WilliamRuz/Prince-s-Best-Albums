      <td class="description">Recording a two-record set at a time when he had yet to become a major star was a risky thing for Prince to do &mdash; but the risk paid off. Upon its release, 1999 became Prince's biggest seller; two singles, "Little Red Corvette" and "Delirious," went
        Top Ten, while the title track reached Number Twelve. Although it contained only eleven songs, clocking in at nearly seventy minutes, 1999 gave Prince the room he needed to address some of his favorite topics: sex, romance, freedom and even rock
        critics, who were toyed with in "All the Critics Love U in New York."

      <td class="description">Produced, arranged, composed and performed by Prince, Sign o' the Times found him back in complete control of every aspect of his music. Aabandoning the neo-psychedelic qualities that had come to the fore on his previous albums, SOTT is his most
        diverse work, with material ranging from the steamy funk of "Hot Thing" and the jazzy balladry of "Slow Love" to more esoteric gems such as "The Ballad of Dorothy Parker" and the fanciful "Starfish and Coffee." This was also the album that marked
        the return of Prince's more controversial side with the sexually provocative "If I Was Your Girlfriend."

      <td class="description">Released in tandem with the film of the same name, Purple Rain was more than simply a soundtrack, and it stands as Prince's most cohesive and accessible album. Purple Rain contained five hit singles, including his first singles to reach Number One,
        "When Doves Cry" and "Let's Go Crazy," as well as "Purple Rain," which reached Number Two. It was also the first Prince album to prominently feature his band the Revolution.
